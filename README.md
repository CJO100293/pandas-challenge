The basis for the code used in both the "# Calculate the average (mean) math score" and "Calculate the average (mean) reading score" sections was found from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35056012/how-to-find-avg-of-column-of-csv-file

The basis for the code used in the "# Calculate the total school budget and per capita spending" section was found from https://github.com/mcarter-00/School-District-Analysis/blob/master/PyCitySchools.ipynb

I worked on the "Math Scores by Grade" and "Reading Scores by Grade" sections with Steve Bennett so if our code for these sections look similar this is why.

In the "# Dependencies and Setup" section where it shows "import warnings" and "warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)" i got the code for this from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15777951/how-to-suppress-pandas-future-warning
