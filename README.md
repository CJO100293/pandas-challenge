## **Background:**
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## **Sources:**
The basis for the code used in both the "# Calculate the average (mean) math score" and "Calculate the average (mean) reading score" sections was found from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35056012/how-to-find-avg-of-column-of-csv-file

The basis for the code used in the "# Calculate the total school budget and per capita spending" section was found from https://github.com/mcarter-00/School-District-Analysis/blob/master/PyCitySchools.ipynb

I worked on the "Math Scores by Grade" and "Reading Scores by Grade" sections with Steve Bennett so if our code for these sections look similar this is why.

In the "# Dependencies and Setup" section where it shows "import warnings" and "warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)" i got the code for this from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15777951/how-to-suppress-pandas-future-warning
